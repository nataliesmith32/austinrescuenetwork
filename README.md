# Machine Learning Solutions To Support Pet Adoption

### This GitHub repo is a collaborative final project for University of Arizona's Data Analytics Bootcamp.
#### Authors: Elizabeth S., Jagrati Joshi, Natalie Smith, Ran Wei, and Veronica Nixon

#### We were concerned by the pet rescue crisis that unfolded during the 2021 winter storms in Austin, Texas and across the south and geared our final project towards exploring machine learning tools and data visualization approaches to support pet rescue and adoption efforts. Using pubicly available data from PetFinder.com and the Austin ___ we experimented with a variety of machine learning and data visualization solutions to learn about the pet adoption situation in Texas and to create tools to help people connect more easily with adoptable pets.

-"Pic-A-Pet": Recommender System Model that provides an interactive experience similar to Tinder or Pandora where prospective pet adopters can vote pets up and down and get iteratively improved recommendations. This system is currently under construction. The code for the system can be viewed in the Pic-a-pet_Recommender_ML_System directory.

-"Pet Chat Bot": Users have an interactive conversation with an ML-powered bot to describe the pet they are looking for. At the end of the conversation, users receive the top 5 best matches and links to the pets on PetFinder.com.

-"Animal Image ML": Users can input a photo of the type of pet they are looking for and receive a list of the closest matching adoptable pets.

-"Description Matching" Recommender System Model: Users enter a description of the type of pet that they are looking for. The model uses a series of machine learning steps to compute the closest pets to fit the user description and returns the top three matches.

-Time to adoption predictions: A Multivariate Regression Model was trained on data from an Austin, Texas rescue organization. The purpose of this model is to predict time to adoption based on the characteristics of a pet. This tool may be useful for pet housing capacity planning. This tool could also be used by organizations to strategize which pets to show to the public on certain high-adoption vs. low-adoption days in order to encourage the adoption of pets that would normally take longer to find their forever homes.
